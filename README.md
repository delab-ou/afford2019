In aodv.py, there is a function genPromelaCsource(nodes=4,around=1,rtlen=2,retry=1)
Args:
nodes: is the number of nodes in a network
around: is the number of neighbor nodes at most when a node broadcasts a packet.
rtlen: is the number of entries in a routing table.
retry: is how many time a source node tries to send a route request.
